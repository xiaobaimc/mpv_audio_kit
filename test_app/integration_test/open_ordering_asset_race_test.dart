// Reentrancy contract for rapid back-to-back `open()` calls when the two
// URIs resolve with different latency. `open()` documents that "the last
// (pause, loadfile) pair wins", but the pair is only issued AFTER
// `resolveUri` completes — and an `asset://` URI does real I/O
// (rootBundle load + temp-file write) while a plain filesystem path
// resolves in one microtask. So `open(A: asset://…)` immediately followed
// by `open(B: /plain/path)` issues B's loadfile FIRST and A's LATER:
// A — the SUPERSEDED request — ends up as the loaded file.
//
// This needs a real Flutter asset bundle, which only the test_app
// integration suite has (the package's host suite bundles no audio
// assets) — hence this lives here and not in `test/`.
