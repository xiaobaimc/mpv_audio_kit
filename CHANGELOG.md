## [0.3.1] - 5-06-2026

### Fixed
- Old build tag in macOS podspec.

## [0.3.0] - 5-06-2026

### Added
- `Player.setMediaSession(MediaSession?)`: publishes the player to the OS media session (Now Playing, Control Center, lockscreen, MPRIS, SMTC, Android notification). Metadata and artwork come from the playing file or override per field; `null` removes the entry.
- `Player.stream.mediaSessionCommands`: transport commands the OS sends back (play, pause, next, seek, repeat, shuffle, speed, and the favourite/like press). Auto-applied to the player and surfaced here for analytics or interception; `MediaSessionCommandLike` is emit-only (no built-in favourite concept).
- `MediaSession`: configures the advertised buttons (`MediaAction`, including the `like`/favourite feedback with its `isFavorite` filled-star state), artwork (`MediaSessionArtwork`), skip intervals, supported speeds, the interruption response (`InterruptionPolicy`), and the app identity (`appName`, `desktopEntry`).
- `Player.state.playWhenReady` / `Player.stream.playWhenReady`: the play/pause *intent* axis, set by `play` / `pause` / `open` / `stop`.
- `Player.setChapters(List<Chapter>)`: injects or replaces the current file's chapter markers by writing mpv's `chapter-list` NODE property directly. `Player.stream.chapters` / `state.chapters` then reflect the injected list, and `setChapter` navigates it natively.
- `Player.setLogLevel(LogLevel)`: changes the engine log verbosity at runtime (the initial value comes from `PlayerConfiguration.logLevel`).
- `Player.stream.prefetchCacheDuration`: how much of the next track the background prefetch has buffered ahead, as a `Duration`. Pair it with `prefetchState` for a determinate "Prefetching…" indicator.
- `Player.stream.waveform` now grows progressively for streams that aren't decodable up front (network / transcode sources), filling in as playback advances. The new `WaveformData.filled` field flags per-bin coverage.
- `Media.httpChunkSize`: opt-in cap (in bytes) on each HTTP range request for a source. Rate-limit a single open-ended request for the whole file, so seeking back freezes once the buffer drains.
- `Media.demuxerLavfOptions`: opt-in per-track options for libmpv's libavformat demuxer, applied as the file-local `demuxer-lavf-o` and scoped to that exact playlist entry.

### Fixed
- `Player.stream.audioOutputState` / `state.audioOutputState` now report `AudioOutputState.failed` when the audio output can't initialize; before, it only ever settled on `closed`.
- `Player.stream.prefetchState` no longer occasionally stays on `loading` when a prefetch is cancelled before its opener starts.
- `Player.stream.waveform` no longer renders a short flat segment at the end when a file's declared duration overshoots the decoded audio.
- `Player.stream.tap(...)` no longer re-emits an identical PCM frame on every poll while paused or stopped at end of content.
- A finished track or playlist now settles the play/pause button back on "play" and reports `state.completed` / `MpvPlaybackState.completed` at the natural end of content.
- `setRawProperty('pause', …)` is now rejected — it bypassed play/pause intent and desynced the OS button; use `Player.play()` / `Player.pause()`.
- A failed first `open(play: true)` no longer leaves the play/pause button stuck on "pause".
- `setAudioDriver('auto')` (and an empty string) now selects mpv's auto-probe instead of failing with "Audio output auto not found".

### Example
- The example app has moved to its own repository as a standalone app, [MPV Studio](https://github.com/ales-drnz/mpv_studio). The bundled `example/` is now a minimal single-file demo.

### Build
- Updated `cacert.pem` to version 1.33.
- Migrated the Android build to Flutter's Built-in Kotlin model.
- The bundled libmpv's `smb2://` protocol now percent-decodes the URL path, user and share (previously only the password).
- Updated libmpv to `libmpv-r8` across all platforms.

## [0.2.3] - 25-05-2026

### Docs
- Branding realignment with the rest of the libraries.

## [0.2.2] - 23-05-2026

### Added
- `AevalSettings` and `AformatSettings` now expose their typed parameters (previously toggle-only).
- Correct numeric bounds on ~116 more parameters that were `null` before — including the whole biquad family's `width_type`, `transform` and `precision`, `atempo.tempo`, and many others. The matching `<param>Min` / `<param>Max` constants now reflect the real ffmpeg ranges.
- New typed enums for the biquad family's `width_type` and `transform`, plus `SurroundWinFunc`.
- Param doc comments now flag which AVOptions ffmpeg marks as runtime-tunable, deprecated, or array-typed. Deprecated parameters also carry a Dart `@Deprecated` annotation.

### Changed
- The six `EBU R128` stat fields (`integrated`, `range`, `lra_low`, `lra_high`, `sample_peak`, `true_peak`) are no longer setter fields on `Ebur128Settings` — ffmpeg flags them as read-only outputs and rejected any attempt to set them. Read them via `af-metadata/<label>` instead.

### Fixed
- `compand.points`, `mcompand.args`, `aiir.{p,z,k,gains,…}`, `firequalizer.gain`, `anequalizer.colors` and other string-grammar parameters now carry their ffmpeg default value instead of an empty default. The hand-written list-typed extensions (`CompandSettings.transferPoints`, `AiirSettings.channels`, `McompandSettings.bands`, …) consequently decode the real ffmpeg default state when the filter is constructed without overrides.

### Build
- Improvements to Swift Package Manager on both iOS and macOS.


## [0.2.1] - 21-05-2026

### Fixed
- Incorrect README mentions.

## [0.2.0] - 21-05-2026

### Added
- `Player.stream.waveform`: a min-max amplitude envelope of the whole track (`WaveformData`) for a static overview strip. Listener-gated, so the background analyzer runs only while a consumer is subscribed.
- `Player.stream.tap(AudioEffect, side: TapSide)`: typed per-filter PCM tap that picks a slot in the effect chain and a `pre` or `post` side. Lazy, arming on the first listener and tearing down on the last cancel.
- `BandProcessor`: public PCM-to-bands processor running the same FFT pipeline as `Player.stream.fft`, for per-filter spectrum curves built from a tap.
- `AudioEffectsX.active`: yields the `AudioEffect` for every enabled slot, so the live effect rack can be iterated without enumerating each typed field.
- Typed extensions for every filter whose lavfi grammar packs structured data into an opaque string: `compand`, `aecho`, `chorus`, `adelay`, `aiir`, `firequalizer`, `afftdn`, `mcompand`, `superequalizer`, `anequalizer`. Each exposes a typed model (`CompandPoint`, `AechoTap`, `AnequalizerBand`, …) and round-trips losslessly.
- `<name>Min`, `<name>Max`, and `<name>Default` constants on every typed `*Settings` class, so UI builders can read each parameter's engine range and default directly.
- The biquad-family `*Settings` (`equalizer`, `bass`, `treble`, `bandpass`, `highpass`, `lowpass`, …) now expose every parameter ffmpeg's biquad chain accepts (`width`, `mix`, `channels`, `normalize`, `transform`, …).
- `SpectrumSettings.overlapFactor`: overlap-add factor for smoother visualizer motion (default `4`, i.e. 75% overlap).
- Enum-typed parameters with a symbolic ffmpeg default are now non-nullable, carrying that documented default.

### Changed
- The real-time FFT frame stream moved from `Player.stream.spectrum` to the new `Player.stream.fft`. `Player.stream.spectrum` is now a reactive view of the current `SpectrumSettings`, emitted on every `setSpectrum` or `updateSpectrum` call.

### Fixed
- Filter values containing `:` `=` `,` or `|` (e.g. `anequalizer.params`, `pan.args`) are now accepted instead of being rejected at chain build.
- Spectrum band magnitudes follow the Web Audio `AnalyserNode` convention (normalised by half the FFT size before the dB conversion). New `SpectrumSettings` defaults: `minDb: -100`, `maxDb: -30`.

### Build
- Switched to OpenSSL for TLS.
- Ffmpeg updated to `8.1.1` and bumped all its dependencies.
- Restored 32-bit ARM Android, Intel macOS, and the Intel iOS Simulator to the bundled binaries.
- iOS and macOS libmpv now ships as a dynamic xcframework (Swift Package Manager builds no longer fail).
- Updated libmpv to `libmpv-r7` across all platforms.

## [0.1.3] - 9-05-2026

### Fixed
- Flutter Hot Restart no longer hangs in debug builds when a `Player` is alive.

## [0.1.2] - 7-05-2026

### Changed
- `Player()` returns immediately during cold start: the heavy libmpv init (library open, handle creation and initialisation, ~80 property observers) now runs on the background event isolate instead of the host isolate.
- The background event isolate now blocks on `mpv_wait_event` instead of polling every 50 ms, eliminating ~20 spurious wake-ups per second during idle playback.
- `dispose()` is robust against being called before `Player()` finishes coming up: it waits for init to settle (or fail) before issuing the cooperative quit and tearing down the streams, so the safety timeout never fires on construction-then-dispose patterns.

### Fixed
- `Media.httpHeaders` now validate keys and values and throw `ArgumentError` on inputs that would corrupt the outgoing HTTP request.
- `Player.add()` and `Player.replace()` now wait for the bundled CA file before emitting `loadfile`, matching `Player.open()`. The first HTTPS append issued immediately after construction no longer races peer verification.
- The Player finalizer now issues a cooperative quit instead of tearing down the handle directly, eliminating a possible crash when a Player is garbage-collected without `dispose()`.

## [0.1.1] - 6-05-2026

### Changed
- Numeric setters now validate at the wrapper boundary and throw `ArgumentError` with a precise stack trace instead of waiting for a round-trip `MpvException`. Affects `setVolume`, `setRate`, `setPitch`, `setVolumeMax`.
- `SpectrumSettings` rejects out-of-range values at construction (FFT size must be a power of two in `[256, 4096]`, smoothing in `[0, 1]`, `bandHighHz > bandLowHz`, etc.) instead of letting them surface as visually-broken output downstream.

### Fixed
- `Media.httpHeaders` now reach mpv on every track, including the first one. Previously they were silently dropped on the first `open()` and applied to the wrong file on subsequent calls.
- `replace()` on the currently-playing entry is now seamless instead of briefly stopping playback before resuming on the new track.
- `setNetworkTimeout` honours sub-second precision; durations below 1s no longer collapse to "no timeout".
- `setTlsCaFile('')` restores the bundled CA default instead of silently disabling peer verification.
- `setTlsCaFile` is now declared on the public `PlayerApi` interface.
- `setReplayGain`, `setCache`, and `setLoop` are now atomic: if any partial write fails, the previous values are restored before the error is rethrown.
- `dispose()` no longer falls through its safety timeout when racing an in-flight `open()`.
- `state.position` is cleared synchronously on `open()` so a UI reading the playhead on track-change no longer briefly shows the previous track's value.
- `state.chapters` and `state.currentChapter` are now refreshed after every load. Two consecutive files with structurally-identical chapter lists previously left both fields stranded at the prior track's value.

### Build
- Added AudioToolbox decoders for macOS and iOS.
- Fixed TLS on macOS and iOS (now aligned with the others).
- Updated libmpv to `libmpv-r6` across all platforms.

## [0.1.0] - 5-05-2026

Major release. The Dart API has been redesigned for type safety, ergonomics, and atomic state mutations.

### Added
- A new `AudioEffects` bundle covering equalizer, compressor, loudness, pitch, tempo, bass, treble, stereo width, headphone crossfeed, silence trim, and raw lavfi effects applied atomically through one setter.
- A-B loop and chapter navigation.
- Aggregate playback-state stream (idle, loading, buffering, playing, paused, completed) for one-line UI bindings.
- 20+ new observable streams covering timing, file metadata, cache, demuxer, and version info.
- Typed `Hook` enum for the file-loading lifecycle.
- New `MpvPrefetchState.failed` variant for when background prefetch fails.
- Typed errors via the `MpvPlayerError` hierarchy and a public `MpvException` for raw-API failures.
- Real-time FFT spectrum and raw PCM streams (`Player.stream.spectrum` / `Player.stream.pcm`) captured post-DSP for visualizers.
- `setTlsCaFile(path)` with custom root-CA bundle.

### Changed
- DSP effects, ReplayGain, and cache settings now live in atomic config objects applied in one call instead of multiple granular setters.
- Track selection, format, channel layout, S/PDIF passthrough, log levels, and hooks are now typed enums and sealed classes instead of free-form strings.
- Embedded cover art is exposed as raw codec bytes through a dedicated `state.coverArt` + `stream.coverArt` pair, with Flutter conveniences (`art.image` returns an `ImageProvider`, plus `art.extension`, `art.isPng`, `art.isJpeg`, …).
- `setAudioDisplay`, `setImageDisplayDuration`, and the `Display` enum are removed - they controlled mpv's video pipeline, which the audio-only build no longer ships. Cover bytes are surfaced regardless via `state.coverArt`.
- Raw-API escape hatches (`getRawProperty`, `setRawProperty`, `sendRawCommand`) are now `Future<...>` and surface mpv-side errors as `MpvException` instead of silently no-oping. `getRawProperty` still returns `null` on failure.
- Every typed setter (`setVolume`, `setRate`, `setAudioEffects`, `setCache`, …) now throws `MpvException` when mpv rejects the write, instead of silently advancing the optimistic state.
- `Player.openPlaylist` renamed to `Player.openAll` (matches Dart's `addAll` / `removeAll` convention).

### Fixed
- The initial player state (volume, format, channels, params, …) is now reliably populated before the first `await`. A startup race could previously leave one or more state fields at their default until the next user-driven setter.
- Calling `dispose()` immediately after construction no longer throws.
- Player instances that get garbage-collected without an explicit `dispose()` now release their native handle automatically. Always prefer `await player.dispose()`; this is just a safety net.
- `Player.dispose()` completes in milliseconds instead of falling through a 2-second timeout.
- HTTP headers no longer leak across `open()` calls; per-file headers stay scoped to their `Media`.
- Android `content://` file descriptors are released on aborted loads, including when an `openAll([...])` fails mid-batch.
- `state.coverArt` now mirrors the latest `stream.coverArt` emit synchronously (was permanently `null` despite being documented).
- `print(state)` and `print(audioEffects)` now render the actual values instead of placeholder text.
- Hot-Restart cleanup is hardened against false positives so a long-lived dev process can't have it trip on memory belonging to other tools.
- Several correctness fixes around playlist equality, hook idempotency, cache precision, and lifecycle stream synchronisation.
- HTTPS streams now connect on Android out of the box; previously TLS verification had no trust roots and every handshake failed.

### Example
- Spectrum visualizer in the Player tab driven by `Player.stream.spectrum`, plus a Settings page exposing every `SpectrumSettings` knob (FFT size, window, band count, range, emit rate, attack, release smoothing, dB range) for live exploration.
- Filters page reorganised into category sub-pages covering every filter shipped with the build, plus a dedicated 18-band visualizer for `superequalizer`.

### Build
- Patched prefetch to also support `.failed` state.
- Patched audio output state to report AO immediately.
- Patched audio frames to extract PCM streams (visualizer).
- Fixed Android `audiotrack` driver not working.
- Bundled libmpv binaries reduced by ~55% (e.g. macOS 29 MB → 13 MB).
- Bumped minimum deployment targets to iOS 15.0 and macOS 12.0.
- iOS Simulator is now Apple Silicon only (dropped x86_64).
- Added arm64 support for Linux and Windows.
- Updated libmpv to `libmpv-r5` across all platforms.

## [0.0.9] - 27-04-2026

### Fixed
- Lifecycle streams (`stream.playing` / `stream.buffering` / `stream.completed`) silently desynced from `state` on file boundaries - `stream.completed` never fired on natural EOF and `stream.buffering` never emitted at all. All three now stay in sync with `state` across every lifecycle transition.
- `dispose()` leaked four stream controllers (audio display, cover-art auto, image display duration, prefetch state). All now closed on teardown.
- Use-after-dispose hazards on `open()` / `openPlaylist()`: disposing the player while URI normalisation was still in flight could SIGSEGV on Android `intent://` loads. Added disposed re-checks after every async boundary.
- Defensive disposal guards on the position polling and embedded-cover pipelines so in-flight work bails instead of writing to closed controllers.
- `setEqualizerGains()` now respects the disposal contract.
- `setAudioFilters()` and `setEqualizerGains()` now route state mutation through the same path as every other setter.
- `openPlaylist(medias, index: N)` no longer silently no-ops when `N >= medias.length`; the index is clamped to `medias.length - 1`.

### Changed
- Reordered the `dispose()` teardown sequence so the event loop exits cleanly without ever calling `mpv_wait_event` on a freed handle.

## [0.0.8] - 24-04-2026

### Added
- `stream.prefetchState` - observable lifecycle of mpv's background playlist-prefetch (`MpvPrefetchState`: `idle`, `loading`, `ready`, `used`).
- `stream.seekCompleted` - authoritative "seek finished" signal that fires exactly once per seek or initial file load.

### Changed
- `on_load` hook now runs for prefetched tracks, so custom URL schemes resolve uniformly whether mpv is opening the current track or pre-opening the next one.
- DASH segment downloads now reuse a single TCP connection across segment GETs (matches HLS persistent-HTTP behaviour).

### Fixed
- Spurious `position = 0` no longer emits on `stream.position` during seek / playback-restart.
- Audible click at every segment boundary on well-formed fragmented-MP4 / DASH streams (AAC encoder priming edit lists are now respected on fMP4).

### Example
- Rewrote the seek slider to release its drag value via `stream.seekCompleted` instead of a fixed delay.

### Build
- Updated libmpv binaries to `libmpv-r4` across all platforms.

## [0.0.7] - 12-04-2026

### Changed
- `audio-format` (u8, s16, s32, float, etc.) now accepts `"no"` and `""` for instant reset to default - previously a full player restart was required.

### Example
- Updated deprecated APIs that prevented the example app from running.

### Build
- Updated libmpv binaries to `libmpv-r3` across all platforms.

## [0.0.6] - 08-04-2026

### Added
- SMB2/3 protocol support (`smb2://`) for Samba (CIFS) network shares via libsmb2.
- Typed error stream - `Stream<MpvPlayerError>` (sealed: `MpvEndFileError`, `MpvLogError`) replaces `Stream<String>`.
- `stream.endFile` (`MpvFileEndedEvent`) for all file-end events, including premature EOF detection.
- `stream.pausedForCache` and `stream.demuxerViaNetwork` for network state monitoring.
- Optional `timeout` parameter on `registerHook` for automatic safety continuation.

### Fixed
- Incorrect name for the audio-stream-silence property.

### Build
- Updated libmpv binaries from `libmpv-r1` to `libmpv-r2` across all platforms.

### Docs
- README fixes and consistency improvements.

## [0.0.4] - 23-03-2026

### Added
- New APIs to configure embedded and external cover-art handling: `setAudioDisplay`, `setCoverArtAuto`, `setImageDisplayDuration`.

### Changed
- Fast jump into playlist now automatically starts playback.

### Example
- Refined Queue tab design and improved stability.
- Added new sliders to DSP filters.

## [0.0.3+2] - 21-03-2026

- Minor fixes.

## [0.0.3+1] - 21-03-2026

### Build
- New tag system for versioning libmpv binaries (`libmpv-r1`, `libmpv-r2`, …) to avoid conflicts with the pub version number on GitHub Releases.

## [0.0.3] - 21-03-2026

### Changed
- **Linux**: bumped minimum supported OS version to Ubuntu 24.04 - required because mpv 0.41.0 enforces a strict dependency on `libpipewire-0.3 >= 0.3.57` for its native PipeWire backend.

### Docs
- Added a detailed *Troubleshooting* section in the README explaining how to correctly satisfy Linux system dependencies when building on containers.

### Example
- Fixed AO menu not showing the default driver automatically.

## [0.0.2+3] - 20-03-2026

### Build
- Updated Linux libmpv: ALSA, PipeWire, and PulseAudio now all work without external dependencies.

## [0.0.2+2] - 18-03-2026

### Changed
- Cleaned up files.

## [0.0.2+1] - 17-03-2026

### Fixed
- Minor fixes.

## [0.0.2] - 17-03-2026

### Added
- Extended documentation.

### Changed
- Restructured the example app's settings UI: each mpv property has its own dedicated page; the stream lab moved to main navigation.

### Fixed
- File picker on macOS.
- Other audio-engine fixes.

## [0.0.1+9] - 16-03-2026

### Added
- New option to choose the AO driver in the example app.
- Added `audio_service` to the example app to test the native OS audio controls.

### Changed
- Re-added the `audiounit` driver alongside `avfoundation` in libmpv for iOS - `audio_service` now works with both.

## [0.0.1+8] - 16-03-2026

### Changed
- Removed the `audiounit` driver from libmpv to fix the native iOS widget for audio control when using the `audio_service` library.

### Fixed
- File picker error in the example app.

## [0.0.1+7] - 16-03-2026

### Fixed
- macOS libs build.
