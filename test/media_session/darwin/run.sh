# Native test runner for the Apple (macOS + iOS) MediaSessionPlugin.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Compiles `darwin/Sources/mpv_audio_kit/MediaSessionPlugin.swift`
#      together with `test/media_session/darwin/main.swift` into a
#      single Mach-O executable.
#   2. Links against `FlutterMacOS.framework` (materialized by a
#      previous `flutter build macos` of the example app) and
#      `MediaPlayer.framework`.
#   3. Runs the executable, which drives the plugin (enable,
#      updatePlayback, handleScrub, disable) and asserts against the
#      real `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default()` and
#      `MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()` after each step.
#
# Requirements:
#   • macOS (uses `swiftc` and Apple frameworks).
#   • The example app must have been built at least once so the
#     Flutter framework is on disk:
#       (cd example && flutter build macos --debug)
#
# Usage:
#   bash test/media_session/darwin/run.sh
#
# Why this lives next to the platform-shared darwin/ Swift source
# rather than inside `darwin/Sources/`: SwiftPM rejects test targets
# that share a folder with a library target, and shipping these as
# part of the published package would bloat pub.dev. They are pure
# internal tooling for the maintainer.
