/// Guards the shape of the Apple Swift sources as they ship to pub.dev.
///
/// The iOS and macOS plugins share their Swift through
/// `darwin/Sources/mpv_audio_kit/`, mirrored into each platform's
/// `Sources/mpv_audio_kit/`. Those mirrors MUST be real files, never
/// symlinks: `dart pub publish` does not preserve symlinks — it writes them
/// into the tarball as regular files whose body is the link-target path, so
/// the consumer's Xcode tries to compile `../../../../darwin/...` as Swift
/// and fails with "Expressions are not allowed at the top level". The host
/// build never sees this because git keeps the symlinks intact locally.
///
/// `scripts/sync_apple_sources.sh` keeps the copies in sync; this test is the
/// invariant that catches a stale copy or an accidentally re-added symlink
/// before publish. Paths are relative to the package root, which is the
/// working directory under `flutter test`.
