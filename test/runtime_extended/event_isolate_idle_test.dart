  // product `1.0` s as of 0.3.4), not the old busy-poll. The bounded floor
  // exists so a Player left undisposed at process exit can't wedge
  // `WaitForIsolateShutdown` (the macOS Dock-Quit hang); the graceful dispose
  // path unblocks instantly via `mpv_wakeup`. Previously the event isolate
  // spun on a 50 ms timeout, waking ~20× / sec just to re-enter the syscall.
  //
  // The wakeup-counter seam (`Player.testInstrumented(wakeupCounterAddress: ...)`) lets
  // us pin the new behaviour deterministically: after the isolate has
  // settled into a quiescent state (no playback, no observed property
  // changes), the counter must stay essentially flat. Pre-fix this
  // would have ticked ~40× over a 2-second window; post-fix it stays
  // at single digits (one or two genuine internal mpv events at most).
