/// Regression coverage for two intent-axis / completed-axis invariants
/// around playlist navigation, against real libmpv.
///
/// 1. `jump()` starts playback (it unpauses before issuing
///    `playlist-play-index`), so it MUST also set the `playWhenReady`
///    intent — like `play()` / `open(play: true)` do. mpv's `pause`
///    property is deliberately unobserved, so nothing downstream can
///    correct a missed optimistic write: the OS play/pause button would
///    read "paused" while audio is audibly playing.
///
/// 2. `completed` must rise ONLY at the true end of content (last
///    playlist entry, no loop). A gapless mid-playlist advance emits
///    MPV_EVENT_END_FILE(EOF) for each finished entry; that per-entry
///    event must not pulse `completed` / `MpvPlaybackState.completed`
///    between two tracks — the same no-flicker contract the
///    `eof-reached` hook enforces via its end-of-content gate.
