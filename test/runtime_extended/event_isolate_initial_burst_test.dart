  // Pins the event-isolate startup contract:
  //
  //   For every observed mpv property (~70 of them), the property's
  //   first emit MUST land on `state` and on `Player.stream.<x>`. Prior
  //   to 0.1.0 the controller was a broadcast `StreamController` and
  //   the listener was registered AFTER `start()` returned — the
  //   initial PROPERTY_CHANGE burst issued by libmpv between
  //   `mpv_observe_property` and the late `listen` was dropped on the
  //   floor (broadcast controllers never buffer).
  //
  //   `volume` is the canary here: it's seeded by `_applyPostInitOptions`
  //   with `configuration.initialVolume` (default 100.0) and libmpv
  //   immediately fires a PROPERTY_CHANGE for it. With the broadcast
  //   race, the first emit was lost and `state.volume` stayed at the
  //   PlayerState default (100.0 by coincidence) until the next
  //   user-driven setVolume.
  //
  //   The observable contract is "the first volume value the consumer
  //   reads from `stream.volume` is the seed mpv reports, not the
  //   PlayerState default" — proven below by configuring a non-default
  //   `initialVolume` and asserting it propagates.
