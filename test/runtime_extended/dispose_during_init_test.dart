// Regression tests for the dispose-during-bring-up lifecycle bugs.
//
// NOTE on the Single-Player-per-file convention (CLAUDE.md): these tests
// inherently create multiple Players sequentially in one file — the
// scenario under test IS "a Player that never finished bring-up was
// disposed; does the process (and the next Player) survive cleanly?".
// Sequential multi-Player usage is a deliberate, documented exception here.
//
// The three bugs covered (all in the dispose-during-init window):
//
// BUG A — `_bringUpInIsolate` (player_init.part.dart:33) early-returns
//   AFTER `_eventIsolate.start(...)` succeeded when `_disposed` flipped
//   during the await. `_lib` / `_handle` are never assigned and
//   `_bringUpCompleted` stays false, so `dispose()` takes the
//   `!_bringUpCompleted` branch and calls `_eventIsolate.stop()` WITHOUT
//   sending `quit` and WITHOUT `requestStop`. The worker isolate keeps
//   looping on `mpv_wait_event` forever (isolate + mpv core leak) and
//   `stop()` burns its full 2 s safety timeout.
//   Red signal: `Player(); await dispose()` takes ~2 s instead of ms.
//
// BUG B — a second concurrent `dispose()` call sees `_disposed == true`
//   (player.dart:811-814) and returns IMMEDIATELY while the first call is
//   still mid-teardown. Correct: the second caller's future completes only
//   when teardown is actually done.
//
// BUG C — a setter that passed `_checkNotDisposed()` and suspended on the
//   pending `_ready`, when dispose lands during init (Bug A path), resumes
//   after the early-returned bring-up and reads the unassigned
//   `late final _lib` → `LateInitializationError` instead of a proper
//   `StateError` (or clean completion).
