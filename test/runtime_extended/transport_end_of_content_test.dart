/// End-to-end coverage for the transport state at end-of-content against
/// real libmpv, under the shipped `keep-open: yes` + `idle: yes` config.
///
/// mpv parks paused on the last frame at the natural end of a single track
/// or the last playlist entry and withholds BOTH `END_FILE` and
/// `idle-active` (verified against mpv 0.41.0 `handle_keep_open`,
/// player/playloop.c:983). The library settles the transport off the
/// `eof-reached` rising edge instead, so:
///   - the play/pause intent (`playWhenReady`, the OS-button binding) is
///     released at the true end of content,
///   - `completed` / `MpvPlaybackState.completed` are reachable for a lone
///     track and for the last playlist entry,
///   - but neither fires at a gapless mid-playlist boundary (no button
///     flicker).
