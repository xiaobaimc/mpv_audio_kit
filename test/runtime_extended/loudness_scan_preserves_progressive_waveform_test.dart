/// Regression pin (behavioural patch — runs against the REAL bundled libmpv):
/// enabling the offline loudness scan mid-playback must NOT reset a
/// PROGRESSIVE waveform that is being grown from playback.
///
/// The bug: `loudness-scan-enabled = yes` used to call `mak_waveform_start`
/// unconditionally, which always bumps the generation and frees the bin
/// arrays before re-arming. For a network adaptive / non-seekable source
/// (Jellyfin/Plex transcode) the waveform is grown live by the af-tap, so the
/// restart wiped every already-accumulated bin — the envelope visibly
/// collapsed the moment the user opened the Now-Playing sheet (which
/// subscribes to `stream.loudness`). For such a source an integrated loudness
/// is impossible anyway (a live transcode cannot be rewound and scanned in
/// full), so the restart was pure loss.
///
/// The fix gates that kick: when a playback-grown PROGRESSIVE/ROLLING envelope
/// is already live the start is skipped (envelope preserved) and the scan is
/// reported `unavailable` directly.
///
/// Reproduced hermetically: a localhost HTTP server serves the 5 s sine FLAC
/// but REFUSES range requests, so the host mpv classifies it as a non-seekable
/// network stream and grows the waveform from playback — exactly the
/// transcode shape, with no external network. If the host mpv nonetheless
/// treats the source as seekable (bulk-decoded), the precondition is not met
/// and the test self-skips rather than asserting against the wrong path.
