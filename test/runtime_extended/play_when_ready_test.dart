/// End-to-end coverage for the `playWhenReady` intent axis against real
/// libmpv.
///
/// `playWhenReady` is the user-intent half of the two-axis transport
/// model (intent × processing-state, as in ExoPlayer / just_audio /
/// AVFoundation). It is what the OS media-session play/pause button
/// binds to, and its load-bearing contract is:
///
/// 1. It emits `true` on the FIRST autoplay open — the case mpv's
///    `pause` property cannot signal (it defaults to `no` and fires no
///    PROPERTY_CHANGE on the first load → playing transition).
/// 2. It NEVER flips to `false` during a seek. mpv flips `core-idle`
///    (→ `state.playing`) transiently on every seek; `playWhenReady`
///    must stay stable so the OS scrub bar's play/pause button does not
///    flicker while scrubbing.
