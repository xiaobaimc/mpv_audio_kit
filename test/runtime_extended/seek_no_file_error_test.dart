// Regression test (red phase): typed command methods discard mpv's
// return code. `sendRawCommand` throws MpvException on rc < 0; the
// typed `seek()` funnels through the same command path but ignores the
// rc, so seeking with no file loaded "succeeds" silently instead of
// surfacing the rejection. Contract under test: typed commands mirror
// the raw escape hatch and throw on mpv rejection.
