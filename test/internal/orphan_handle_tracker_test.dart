// OrphanHandleTracker smoke — the tracker is a singleton keyed by the
// running pid + tmp file, and its full Hot-Restart cleanup flow can
// only be reproduced inside a real Flutter app between hot-restarts.
// This file exercises the API surface end-to-end **without** depending
// on the singleton being fresh: ensureInitialized + add(0xdeadbeef) +
// remove(0xdeadbeef) must complete without throwing, and the file at
// `<tmp>/mpv_audio_kit_refs_<pid>.txt` must exist after init.
