// libmpv ships as a dynamic .xcframework, consumed via a SwiftPM
// .binaryTarget. Two interchangeable forms — keep exactly ONE active:
//
//   • url + checksum — downloads the xcframework from this package's
//     GitHub Releases. The standard practice for a distributed binary;
//     use this once the release zip is published.
//   • path — uses a libmpv.xcframework already in Frameworks/. Use
//     this to test a local libmpv build before publishing a release.
