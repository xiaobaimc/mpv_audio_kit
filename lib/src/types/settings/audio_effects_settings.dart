/// Configuration for the `acompressor` audio effect.
///
/// A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
/// Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
/// improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention
/// of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
/// If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
/// afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
/// but can also destroy a track completely).
/// The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
/// the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
/// it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.
///
/// Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
/// `threshold` and dividing it by the factor set with `ratio`.
/// So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio
/// of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
/// the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
/// levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
/// `attack` determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
/// before any reduction will occur and `release` sets the time the signal
/// has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
/// than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
/// The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
/// `makeup` setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
/// raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
/// source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the `knee` flattens the
/// hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.
///
/// The filter accepts the following options:
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [attack]: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000. (range 0.01..2000, default 20)
/// - [detection]: Should the exact signal be taken in case of `peak` or an RMS one in case of `rms`. Default is `rms` which is mostly smoother. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [knee]: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8. (range 1..8, default 2.82843)
/// - [level_in]: Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64. (range 0.015625..64, default 1)
/// - [level_sc]: set sidechain gain (range 0.015625..64, default 1)
/// - [link]: Choose if the `average` level between all channels of input stream or the louder(`maximum`) channel of input stream affects the reduction. Default is `average`. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [makeup]: Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64. (range 1..64, default 1)
/// - [mix]: How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [mode]: Set mode of compressor operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`. Default is `downward`. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [ratio]: Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20. (range 1..20, default 2)
/// - [release]: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000. (range 0.01..9000, default 250)
/// - [threshold]: If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction. By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1. (range 0.000976563..1, default 0.125)

/// and dividing it by the factor set with `ratio`. The bottom of the noise
/// floor is set via `range`. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
/// would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
/// time. This is done by setting `attack` and `release`.
///
/// `attack` determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
/// before any reduction will occur and `release` sets the time the signal
/// has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
/// Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [attack]: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000. (range 0.01..9000, default 20)

/// - [knee]: Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8. (range 1..8, default 2.828427125)
/// - [level_in]: Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64. (range 0.015625..64, default 1)
/// - [level_sc]: set sidechain gain (range 0.015625..64, default 1)
/// - [link]: Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is `average`. Can be `average` or `maximum`. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [makeup]: Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64. (range 1..64, default 1)
/// - [mode]: Set the mode of operation. Can be `upward` or `downward`. Default is `downward`. If set to `upward` mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of `downward` lower parts of signal will be reduced.

/// - [range]: Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander. (range 0..1, default 0.06125)

/// - [release]: Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000. (range 0.01..9000, default 250)

/// - [decays]: A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. `attacks` refers to increase of volume and `decays` refers to decrease of volume. For most situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels. (range 0..0, default "0.8")
/// - [delay]: Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0. (range 0..20, default 0)
/// - [gain]: Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain. It defaults to 0. (range -900..900, default 0)
/// - [points]: A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using the following syntax: `x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....` or `x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....`  The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising. The point `0/0` is assumed but may be overridden (by `0/out-dBn`). Typical values for the transfer function are `-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0`. (range 0..0)
/// - [volume]: Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0. (range -900..0, default 0)

/// Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.

/// sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the

/// this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
/// of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [altboundary]: Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood around each frame.

Thus, the question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and "fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.

That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from 0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction. With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract that value from all of the frame's sample values which ensures those samples are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring frames. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [channels]: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered. (range 0..0, default "all")
/// - [compress]: Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional" compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However, in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression. For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled, all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual frame. In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa. Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear. (range 0.0..30.0, default 0.0)
/// - [correctdc]: Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled. An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values. In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the -1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point. That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that value.

Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring frames. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [coupling]: Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e. the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel. However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s). In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending only on the individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for harmonizing the volume of the different channels. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [curve]: Specify the peak mapping curve expression which is going to be used when calculating gain applied to frames. The max output frame gain will still be limited by other options mentioned previously for this filter.  The expression can contain the following constants: (default NULL)
/// - [f]: Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard" normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has been found to give good results with most files. Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file. (range 10..8000, default 500)
/// - [framelen]: Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value.

Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file. (range 10..8000, default 500)
/// - [g]: Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd number. Default is 31. Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the `window size` of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation. In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor. (range 3..301, default 31)
/// - [gausssize]: Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd number. Default is 31.

/// - [h]: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered. (range 0..0, default "all")
/// - [m]: Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by the frame's highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds the frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold). Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that value. (range 1.0..100.0, default 10.0)
/// - [maxgain]: Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by the frame's highest magnitude sample.

This allows for harmonizing the volume of the different channels. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [o]: Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done. Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time compared to zero overlap case. (range 0.0..1.0, default .0)
/// - [overlap]: Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done. Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time compared to zero overlap case. (range 0.0..1.0, default .0)
/// - [p]: Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude. A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*. It is not recommended to go above this value. (range 0.0..1.0, default 0.95)
/// - [peak]: Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude. A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*. It is not recommended to go above this value. (range 0.0..1.0, default 0.95)
/// - [r]: Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization. This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined (only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame's local gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value. Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping. (range 0.0..1.0, default 0.0)
/// - [s]: Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional" compression.

/// - [t]: Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized. If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized. Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized. This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified. (range 0.0..1.0, default 0.0)
/// - [targetrms]: Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.

/// The filter also has a video output (see the `video` option) with a real
/// time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
/// message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
/// unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
/// short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
/// the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured

/// - [dualmono]: treat mono input files as dual-mono (range 0..1, default 0)

/// - [gauge]: set gauge display type (default 0)
/// - [integrated]: integrated loudness (LUFS) (default 0)
/// - [lra_high]: LRA high (LUFS) (default 0)
/// - [lra_low]: LRA low (LUFS) (default 0)
/// - [metadata]: Set metadata injection. If set to `1`, the audio input will be segmented into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information in metadata.  All the metadata keys are prefixed with `lavfi.r128.`.  Default is `0`. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [meter]: Set the EBU scale meter. Default is `9`. Common values are `9` and `18`, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any other integer value between this range is allowed. (range 9..18, default 9)
/// - [panlaw]: set a specific pan law for dual-mono files (range -10.0..0.0, default -3.01029995663978)
/// - [peak]: set peak mode (default PEAK_MODE_NONE)
/// - [range]: loudness range (LU) (default 0)
/// - [sample_peak]: sample peak (dBFS) (default 0)
/// - [scale]: sets display method for the stats (default 0)
/// - [target]: set a specific target level in LUFS (-23 to 0) (range -23..0, default -23)
/// - [true_peak]: true peak (dBFS) (default 0)

/// Configuration for the `loudnorm` audio effect.
///
/// EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization modes.
/// Support for both single pass (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes.
/// This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. In dynamic mode, to accurately
/// detect true peaks, the audio stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz.
/// Use the `-ar` option or `aresample` filter to explicitly set an output sample rate.
///
/// The filter accepts the following options:
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [I]: Set integrated loudness target. Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -24.0. (range -70.0..-5.0, default -24.)
/// - [LRA]: Set loudness range target. Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default value is 7.0. (range 1.0..50.0, default 7.)
/// - [TP]: Set maximum true peak. Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -2.0. (range -9.0..0.0, default -2.)
/// - [dual_mono]: Treat mono input files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to `true`, this option will compensate for this effect. Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option. Options are true or false. Default is false. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [i]: Set integrated loudness target. Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -24.0. (range -70.0..-5.0, default -24.)
/// - [linear]: Normalize by linearly scaling the source audio. `measured_I`, `measured_LRA`, `measured_TP`, and `measured_thresh` must all be specified. Target LRA shouldn't be lower than source LRA and the change in integrated loudness shouldn't result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these conditions aren't met, normalization mode will revert to `dynamic`. Options are `true` or `false`. Default is `true`. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [lra]: Set loudness range target. Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default value is 7.0. (range 1.0..50.0, default 7.)
/// - [measured_I]: Measured IL of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0. (range -99.0..0.0, default 0.)
/// - [measured_LRA]: Measured LRA of input file. Range is  0.0 - 99.0. (range 0.0..99.0, default 0.)
/// - [measured_TP]: Measured true peak of input file. Range is  -99.0 - +99.0. (range -99.0..99.0, default 99.)
/// - [measured_i]: Measured IL of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0. (range -99.0..0.0, default 0.)
/// - [measured_lra]: Measured LRA of input file. Range is  0.0 - 99.0. (range 0.0..99.0, default 0.)
/// - [measured_thresh]: Measured threshold of input file. Range is -99.0 - +0.0. (range -99.0..0.0, default -70.)
/// - [measured_tp]: Measured true peak of input file. Range is  -99.0 - +99.0. (range -99.0..99.0, default 99.)
/// - [offset]: Set offset gain. Gain is applied before the true-peak limiter. Range is  -99.0 - +99.0. Default is +0.0. (range -99.0..99.0, default 0.)
/// - [print_format]: Set print format for stats. Options are summary, json, or none. Default value is none. (default NONE)
/// - [tp]: Set maximum true peak. Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -2.0. (range -9.0..0.0, default -2.)

/// Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

/// The filter accepts the following options:
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [detection]: Set how is silence detected. (default D_RMS)
/// - [start_duration]: Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence and trimmed off. Default value is `0`. (default 0)
/// - [start_mode]: Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio. Can be `any` or `all`. Default is `any`. With `any`, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream. With `all`, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage. (default T_ANY)
/// - [start_periods]: This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio the `start_periods` will be `1` but it can be increased to higher values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods. Default value is `0`. (range 0..9000, default 0)
/// - [start_silence]: Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence. (default 0)
/// - [start_threshold]: This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital audio, a value of `0` may be fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is `0`. (default 0)
/// - [stop_duration]: Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio. Default value is `0`. (default 0)
/// - [stop_mode]: Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio. Can be `any` or `all`. Default is `all`. With `any`, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage. With `all`, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream. (default T_ALL)
/// - [stop_periods]: Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a positive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period. To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a `stop_periods` that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by `stop_periods`, making it suitable for removing periods of silence in the middle of the audio. Default value is `0`. (range -9000..9000, default 0)
/// - [stop_silence]: Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence. (default 0)
/// - [stop_threshold]: This is the same as @option{start_threshold} but for trimming silence from the end of audio. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is `0`. (default 0)
/// - [timestamp]: Set processing mode of every audio frame output timestamp. (default TS_WRITE)
/// - [window]: Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number of samples for detecting silence. Using `0` will effectively disable any windowing and use only single sample per channel for silence detection. In that case it may be needed to also set @option{start_silence} and/or @option{stop_silence} to nonzero values with also @option{start_duration} and/or @option{stop_duration} to nonzero values. Default value is `0.02`. Allowed range is from `0` to `10`. (range 0..100000000, default 20000)

/// This is also known as shelving equalisation (EQ).
///
/// The filter accepts the following options:
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [a]: Set transform type of IIR filter. (default DI)
/// - [b]: Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.  Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value. (range 0..32768, default 0)
/// - [blocksize]: set the block size (range 0..32768, default 0)
/// - [c]: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered. (range 0..0, default "all")
/// - [channels]: Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered. (range 0..0, default "all")
/// - [f]: Set the filter's central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is `3000` Hz. (range 0..999999, default 3000)
/// - [frequency]: Set the filter's central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut. The default value is `3000` Hz. (range 0..999999, default 3000)
/// - [g]: Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain. (range -900..900, default 0)
/// - [gain]: Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain. (range -900..900, default 0)
/// - [m]: How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [mix]: How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1. (range 0..1, default 1)
/// - [n]: Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [normalize]: Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled. Enabling it will normalize magnitude response at DC to 0dB. (range 0..1, default 0)
/// - [p]: Set number of poles. Default is 2. (range 1..2, default 2)
/// - [poles]: Set number of poles. Default is 2. (range 1..2, default 2)
/// - [precision]: Set precision of filtering. (range -1..3, default -1)
/// - [r]: Set precision of filtering. (range -1..3, default -1)
/// - [t]: Set method to specify band-width of filter. (default QFACTOR)
/// - [transform]: Set transform type of IIR filter. (default DI)
/// - [w]: Determine how steep is the filter's shelf transition. (range 0..99999, default 0.5)
/// - [width]: Determine how steep is the filter's shelf transition. (range 0..99999, default 0.5)
