/// Result of the offline loudness scan (EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770) of the
/// loaded source, emitted on `PlayerStream.loudness`.
///
/// Unlike the live `PlayerStream.loudnessMeter` — which measures audio as
/// it plays — the scan decodes the whole file off the playback path at
/// many times realtime, so the integrated loudness of the entire track is
/// known moments after the file loads. Use it to normalize playback volume
/// for tracks without ReplayGain tags:
///
/// ```dart
/// player.stream.loudness.listen((scan) {
///   if (scan?.state == LoudnessScanState.ready) {
///     final gainDb = -18.0 - scan!.integrated!; // ReplayGain 2.0 reference
///     player.setVolumeGain(gainDb.clamp(-24.0, 24.0));
///   }
/// });
/// ```
///
/// The measurement fields are non-null only when [state] is
/// [LoudnessScanState.ready].

  /// Scan lifecycle state. The stream emits terminal states only
  /// ([LoudnessScanState.ready], [LoudnessScanState.failed],
