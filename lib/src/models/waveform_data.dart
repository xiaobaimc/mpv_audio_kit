/// Mono min/max amplitude envelope of the audio currently loaded.
///
/// Emitted once per track on [PlayerStream.waveform] after the engine
/// finishes decoding the file in the background. The track is mixed
/// down to mono and binned into a fixed ~2000-entry envelope.
///
/// Bin `i` spans the time slice
/// `[start + i / bins * duration, start + (i + 1) / bins * duration)`.
/// [min] and [max] hold the lowest and highest sample value seen in each
/// bin, range `[-1.0, +1.0]`.
///
/// For a normal (known-length) track [start] is zero and [duration] is the
/// whole track, so bins map onto `[0, duration]`. For a **live** stream
/// ([live] == true) there is no total length: the envelope is a sliding
/// window kept in lockstep with the demuxer's seekable cache, so [start] is
/// the absolute media time of bin 0 (the oldest still-cached moment) and
/// [duration] is the span currently held (it grows while you listen and
/// only drops its oldest bins once the demuxer evicts that audio from its
/// back-buffer). The newest bin is "now". Map bins with [start]/[duration]
/// in absolute media time and you can scrub anywhere the cache still
/// covers.
///
/// Example — paint a bar per bin:
///
/// ```dart
/// player.stream.waveform.listen((wave) {
///   if (wave == null) return;
///   for (var i = 0; i < wave.bins; i++) {
///     final yMin = wave.min[i] * canvasHeight / 2;
///     final yMax = wave.max[i] * canvasHeight / 2;
///     // draw bar i from yMin to yMax …
///   }
/// });
/// ```
