/// Media-session setter: publishes the [Player] to the OS lockscreen /
/// SMTC / MPRIS entry, wires Bluetooth AVRCP and headset buttons, and
/// (when enabled) integrates with the platform's audio-session
/// lifecycle for phone-call / Siri / navigation auto-pause.
///
/// Pass `null` to disable. Only one [Player] per process can hold the
/// session — see [Player._mediaSessionOwner]. `dispose()` releases the
/// session automatically before tearing down libmpv.
///
/// Lifecycle:
/// - First non-null call: registers the static guard, allocates a
///   [MediaSessionController] that pushes state to the native side
///   and listens for inbound OS commands.
/// - Subsequent non-null calls: reconfigure (controller stays alive,
///   the new config flows through `state.mediaSession` → stream →
///   controller).
/// - `null` call: tears the controller down, clears the static guard.
///
/// Inbound commands are auto-applied to the [Player] (play → play(),
/// seek → seek(), …) AND emitted on
/// [PlayerStream.mediaSessionCommands] for analytics / interception.
/// `next` / `previous` are routed to mpv's playlist when one is
/// loaded; otherwise they only emit on the consumer stream so the
/// app's queue logic can react.
