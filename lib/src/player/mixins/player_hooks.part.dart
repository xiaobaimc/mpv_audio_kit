/// Hook setters: register / continue mpv hooks. Hooks let you intercept
/// mpv's file-loading pipeline to lazily resolve a URL, inject per-file
/// HTTP headers, or redirect to a different source.
///
/// Usage pattern:
/// ```dart
/// player.registerHook(Hook.load);
/// player.stream.hook.listen((event) async {
///   if (event.hook == Hook.load) {
///     final url = await player.getRawProperty('stream-open-filename') ?? '';
///     // Optionally redirect the URL:
///     await player.setRawProperty('stream-open-filename', newUrl);
///     // Optionally set per-file HTTP headers:
///     await player.setRawProperty(
///         'file-local-options/http-header-fields', 'X-Token: abc');
///   }
///   player.continueHook(event.id); // must always be called
/// });
/// ```

  /// Hook events are delivered via [PlayerStream.hook]. Call
  /// [continueHook] with the event's [MpvHookEvent.id] when processing
  /// is complete — until then, mpv suspends the operation guarded by
  /// this hook.
  ///
  /// If [timeout] is provided, the library automatically calls
  /// [continueHook] after the given duration if you haven't called it
  /// yet. Prevents mpv from stalling indefinitely on unhandled
  /// exceptions in the listener.
  ///
  /// Idempotent per [hook]: calling [registerHook] more than once for
  /// the same hook on the same [Player] only updates the optional
  /// [timeout]; the underlying mpv registration happens once. mpv
  /// allows multiple registrations per name but its shutdown path can
  /// stall when several events for the same hook are still active at
  /// `quit` — duplicates are collapsed here to avoid that race.
  ///

  /// [priority] values run earlier; the default (0) is fine for most
  /// uses.
