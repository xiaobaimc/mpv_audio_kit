/// Declarative description of a single mpv property exposed by the player.
///
/// One spec bundles the mpv property name + format, the [ReactiveProperty]
/// cell that owns the value, a `(raw, state) → T` parser, and a
/// `(T, state) → PlayerState` reducer. The full update pipeline runs on
/// every observed change: parse → dedup → reactive update → state reduce
/// → onChange. Adding an observed property to the public API is a
/// one-line edit to the spec list.
///
/// The generic [T] is the type of the [reactive] cell. For scalar
/// properties [T] is also the parsed value type. For aggregate properties
/// the parser folds the new value into a larger config (read out of
/// [PlayerState] via the parser's `state` argument) and returns the
/// whole aggregate, so the reactive dedups on the full struct.
